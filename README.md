Senior project 
Its a Zone Control HVAC System that allows its users to control the temperature of their rooms individually. Once a user set a room temperature the system will automatically keep it at that vaule by turning the AC ON/OFF as well as opening and closing the vent.

It simulated how the system automatically control the rooms temperatures to there preset values.

As I got tired of working on the project. It decided to something different(freshen up) on the side. So I created these webpages which contains pictures, videos and documented steps of how the project was done. There is still few docs or pics yet to be uploaded to the webpages</br>
